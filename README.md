# Image Processing Application

## **Overview**

Digital image processing plays a pivotal role in numerous fields, ranging from medicine and engineering to entertainment and security. With the advancement of technology, the ability to manipulate, analyze, and extract valuable information from digital images has become increasingly important. In response to this growing demand, the **Image Processing Application** was developed as a versatile tool to facilitate image processing tasks.

The **Image Processing Application** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool that integrates powerful libraries such as Tkinter, OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL. This application empowers users to perform a wide array of image processing operations with ease, offering a user-friendly interface for loading images, applying filters, detecting edges, segmenting objects, and extracting features.

## **Features**

- **Image Upload and Save**: Easily load and save images using the intuitive buttons in the GUI.
- **Filters**: Apply various filters to images, including:
  1. Prewitt Edge Detector
  2. Roberts Edge Detector
  3. Sobel Edge Detector
  4. Erosion
  5. Dilation
  6. Opening
  7. Closing
  8. Thresholding Segmentation
  9. Hough Circle Transform
  10. Low Pass Filter (LPF)
  11. High Pass Filter (HPF)
  12. Mean Filter
  13. Median Filter

## **Usage**

1. **Load an Image**: Click the "Load Image" button to select an image file from your system.
2. **Apply Filters**: Choose from the available filters to process the loaded image.
3. **Save the Processed Image**: Click the "Save Image" button to save the processed image to your system.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)
